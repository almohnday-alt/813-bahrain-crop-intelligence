# Bahrain Crop Intelligence

## Satellite-Based Crop Monitoring in Buri, Bahrain

**Arab Youth Space Hackathon — 813 Challenge**
**Theme: Precision Agriculture & Crop Intelligence**

### Project Overview

This proof of concept explores how satellite-derived vegetation and moisture indicators can support agricultural monitoring in Buri, Bahrain.

### Study Data

* **Study area:** Buri, Bahrain
* **Satellite:** Sentinel-2 Level-2A
* **Data source:** Copernicus Browser
* **Observation period:** 16 August–15 September 2026
* **Number of observation dates:** 8
* **Indicators:** NDVI and NDMI

### Preliminary Results

The correlation between mean NDMI and mean NDVI was **r = 0.668**, with **R² = 0.4456**, based on eight paired observations.

These results indicate an association between the two indicators in this dataset. They do not independently confirm crop water stress or determine irrigation requirements.

### Limitations

The analysis covers one selected agricultural area and eight observation dates. Field measurements and additional environmental information are needed to validate possible crop water stress.

### Project Notebook

See [02_buri_sentinel2_analysis.ipynb](02_buri_sentinel2_analysis.ipynb) for the Buri Sentinel-2 analysis.

## 🎯 The Six Challenge Themes

Teams choose **one theme** and build a data-driven, AI-powered proof-of-concept solution using real hyperspectral satellite imagery.

---

### 🌾 Theme 1 — Precision Agriculture & Crop Intelligence

> *Leverage hyperspectral data to monitor crop health, optimize irrigation, and detect pest or disease stress across Arab agricultural zones.*

**Why it matters:** The Arab world faces acute food security challenges. Hyperspectral imagery can detect crop stress **weeks before visible damage appears**, enabling precision interventions that reduce water use, chemical inputs, and yield loss.

**Key capabilities unlocked by Tanager:**
- Chlorophyll content mapping (early disease/stress detection)
- Leaf water content (irrigation deficit monitoring)
- Crop type discrimination across fields
- Soil organic matter and salinity proxies

**Relevant STAC collection:**
```
https://www.planet.com/data/stac/tanager-core-imagery/agriculture/collection.json
```

**Starter notebook:** [`01_agriculture_crop_intelligence.ipynb`](notebooks/01_agriculture_crop_intelligence.ipynb)

---

### 🏙️ Theme 2 — Urban Expansion, Land Use Change & Heat Risk

> *Quantify urban growth, map land-use transitions, and assess urban heat island intensity and heat risk for cities across the Arab world.*

**Why it matters:** Arab cities are among the world's fastest-growing. Unchecked urban sprawl consumes agricultural land, increases heat stress, and strains water infrastructure.

**Key capabilities unlocked by Tanager:**
- Built-up surface detection (NDBI, BUI)
- Impervious surface extent mapping
- Land cover change detection across time
- Urban green space monitoring

**Relevant STAC collections:**
```
https://www.planet.com/data/stac/tanager-core-imagery/urban/collection.json
https://www.planet.com/data/stac/tanager-core-imagery/natural-lands/collection.json
```

**Starter notebook:** [`02_land_use_land_cover_change.ipynb`](notebooks/02_land_use_land_cover_change.ipynb)

---

### 💨 Theme 3 — Air Quality & GHG Plumes

> *Detect and quantify methane and CO₂ point-source emissions from oil and gas infrastructure, landfills, and agricultural facilities.*

**Why it matters:** Methane is 80× more potent than CO₂ over 20 years. Tanager is one of the few satellites that can detect individual facility-level methane plumes — a capability critical to achieving net-zero targets.

**Key capabilities unlocked by Tanager:**
- Methane absorption feature detection at 2,300 nm
- Plume mapping and source attribution
- CO₂ enhancement detection
- Integration with facility-level infrastructure data

**Relevant STAC collection:**
```
https://www.planet.com/data/stac/tanager-core-imagery/GHG-plumes/collection.json
```

**Starter notebook:** [`03_air_quality_ghg_plumes.ipynb`](notebooks/03_air_quality_ghg_plumes.ipynb)

---

### 🔥 Theme 4 — Climate-Induced Disasters

> *Early detection and impact assessment of climate-driven extreme events — floods, droughts, dust storms, wildfires — using satellite time series and AI.*

**Why it matters:** The Arab world is increasingly exposed to climate-driven disasters. Rapid, satellite-based assessment reduces emergency response time and supports early warning systems.

**Key capabilities unlocked by Tanager:**
- Burn scar mapping and fire severity classification (NBR, BAIM)
- Flood inundation extent (NDWI)
- Post-disaster change detection
- Drought stress indicators

**Relevant STAC collections:**
```
https://www.planet.com/data/stac/tanager-core-imagery/fire/collection.json
https://www.planet.com/data/stac/browser/disasters/collection.json
```

**Starter notebook:** [`04_climate_disasters_fire_flood.ipynb`](notebooks/04_climate_disasters_fire_flood.ipynb)

---

### 🌿 Theme 5 — Ecosystem Health, Biodiversity & Blue Carbon

> *Assess terrestrial and coastal ecosystem vitality — including mangrove extent, blue carbon stocks, and biodiversity corridors — using multi-source satellite data.*

**Why it matters:** Blue carbon ecosystems (mangroves, seagrass, salt marshes) store up to 5× more carbon per hectare than tropical forests. The Arabian Peninsula hosts some of the world's most climatically stressed mangrove ecosystems.

**Key capabilities unlocked by Tanager:**
- Mangrove species discrimination
- Chlorophyll and phytoplankton detection in coastal water
- Harmful algal bloom (HAB) early warning
- Ecosystem stress mapping

**Relevant STAC collection:**
```
https://www.planet.com/data/stac/tanager-core-imagery/coastal-water-bodies/collection.json
```

**Starter notebook:** [`05_ecosystem_health_blue_carbon.ipynb`](notebooks/05_ecosystem_health_blue_carbon.ipynb)

---

### 💧 Theme 6 — Water Quality & Inland/Coastal Water Intelligence

> *Monitor water clarity, algal blooms, turbidity, and pollution plumes in inland and coastal water bodies.*

**Why it matters:** Water scarcity is the defining challenge of the Arab world. Hyperspectral satellites can monitor reservoir health, detect pollution events, and track coastal water quality — at a fraction of the cost of field sampling.

**Key capabilities unlocked by Tanager:**
- Turbidity and suspended sediment mapping
- Chlorophyll-a concentration (algal biomass)
- Dissolved organic matter estimation
- Coastal water body change detection

**Relevant STAC collection:**
```
https://www.planet.com/data/stac/tanager-core-imagery/coastal-water-bodies/collection.json
```

> This theme shares the same STAC collection as Theme 5 but focuses on **water quality parameters** rather than vegetation. The base exploration notebook covers NDWI, NDCI, and turbidity proxies applicable here.

### 7. Theme 6: Water Quality & Inland/Coastal Water Intelligence

**Starter notebook:** Use `notebooks/05_ecosystem_health_blue_carbon.ipynb` as your base.

The ecosystem notebook computes NDWI (water extent), NDCI (chlorophyll/algae), and Turbidity — the three indices most relevant to water quality monitoring. Extend it by:

- Thresholding NDWI to isolate open water pixels
- Applying NDCI to water-masked pixels only (filtering out land)
- Computing a Floating Algae Index (FAI) using NIR/SWIR contrast
- Correlating with in-situ measurements if available

For reservoir / inland water scenes, also check the `coastal-water-bodies` collection — it includes scenes over both marine and freshwater environments.

## ▶️ How to Run the Notebooks

> 💡 **New here?** Start with `00_EO_data_quickstart_notebook.ipynb` — it covers environment setup, key concepts (STAC, COGs, bands, hyperspectral vs. multispectral), and troubleshooting tips that apply across all the notebooks. Each theme notebook (`01`–`06`) is still self-contained and installs its own dependencies, so you can jump straight to one if you prefer.

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended — no local setup)

Click the badge to open any notebook directly in Colab:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR-ORG/arab-813-hackathon/blob/main/notebooks/00_data_exploration_starter.ipynb)

All notebooks run `%pip install` in their first code cell — no local setup needed.

---

### Option 2: Local Jupyter Environment

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.9+

**Using `pip` + `venv`:**

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Tnecniv-Teikram/813-hyperspectral-hackathon.git
cd 813-hyperspectral-hackathon

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

**Using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (faster):**

```bash
# 0. Install uv (skip if you already have it)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # macOS/Linux
# powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"   # Windows

# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Tnecniv-Teikram/813-hyperspectral-hackathon.git
cd 813-hyperspectral-hackathon

# 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch Jupyter
uv run jupyter notebook
```

### Space42 gIQ Platform

Selected teams receive access to the **Space42 gIQ Platform** — a pre-configured cloud environment with all dependencies installed, direct data access, and deployment tooling. No local installation needed.

### ⚠️ Known Issue: leafmap Titiler Endpoint Conflict

If you run the Planetary Computer (Sentinel-2) cells **before** the Planet Tanager cells in the same kernel session, leafmap caches a `PlanetaryComputerEndpoint` object and breaks all subsequent `add_cog_layer` calls with:

```
Invalid URL '<leafmap.stac.PlanetaryComputerEndpoint object at 0x...>/cog/info'
```

**Fix:** All Tanager notebooks include this near the top — ensure it runs before any map cell:

```python
import os
os.environ["TITILER_ENDPOINT"] = "https://titiler.xyz"
```

---

### ⚠️ HDF5 Download Times

Tanager surface reflectance HDF5 files are typically **1–5 GB** each.

| Connection Speed | Estimated Download Time |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| 100 Mbps | 1–5 minutes |
| 50 Mbps | 2–10 minutes |
| 10 Mbps | 10–45 minutes |

The notebooks check `os.path.exists(local_path)` before downloading — re-running a cell will **not** re-download an already saved file.

---

## 🔭 Understanding Tanager Hyperspectral Data

### What is hyperspectral imagery?

An ordinary photograph records **3 bands** (red, green, blue) — what the human eye sees. Tanager records **426 narrow bands** from 380 nm to 2,500 nm.

```
Ordinary camera:  [ Red | Green | Blue ]
                    3 bands — ~100 nm each

Tanager:          [||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]
                    426 bands — ~5 nm each, continuously from 380–2500 nm
```

This allows Tanager to detect:
- **Chlorophyll stress** before leaves visibly wilt (680 nm + red-edge at 720 nm)
- **Leaf water content** (NIR and SWIR contrast)
- **Soil composition** (clay, iron oxide, carbonate minerals have SWIR signatures)
- **Methane** (absorption at 2,300 nm)
- **Water quality** (blue/green ratios, turbidity)

### HDF5 File Structure

Every Tanager surface reflectance file follows this structure:

```
HDFEOS/GRIDS/HYP/Data Fields/
├── surface_reflectance      (426, rows, cols) float32  ← main data cube
├── beta_cloud_mask          (rows, cols) uint8
├── beta_cirrus_mask         (rows, cols) uint8
├── nodata_pixels            (rows, cols) uint8
├── aerosol_optical_depth    (rows, cols) float32
├── column_water_vapour      (rows, cols) float32
├── sensor_zenith            (rows, cols) float32
└── sun_zenith               (rows, cols) float32
```

### Reading Wavelength Metadata

Wavelengths are stored in the STAC item under the `bands` key as `eo:center_wavelength` (in micrometers):

```python
bands_meta = item["assets"][sr_key].get("bands", [])
spectral_bands = [b for b in bands_meta if "eo:center_wavelength" in b]
wavelengths_um = np.array([b["eo:center_wavelength"] for b in spectral_bands])
wavelengths_nm = wavelengths_um * 1000.0   # convert µm → nm
```

> **Common pitfall:** The key is `"eo:center_wavelength"` (with the `eo:` prefix), not `"center_wavelength"`. This tripped up even experienced users — all notebooks use the correct form.

### Water Vapor Absorption Windows

These two spectral regions measure **atmospheric opacity**, not ground reflectance. Always exclude them:

| Region | Wavelengths | Cause |
|--------|------------|-------|
| SWIR-1 water vapor | 1,350 – 1,450 nm | Atmospheric H₂O |
| SWIR-2 water vapor | 1,800 – 1,950 nm | Atmospheric H₂O |

All notebooks include:

```python
def is_water_vapor(wl):
    return (1350 <= wl <= 1450) or (1800 <= wl <= 1950)
```

## Buri, Bahrain — Sentinel-2 Vegetation Monitoring

### Objective

To monitor changes in vegetation condition and moisture-related signals in the agricultural study area of Buri, Bahrain.

### Data and Methodology

Eight Sentinel-2 Level-2A observations from Copernicus Browser, covering 16 August to 15 September 2026, were analyzed using mean NDVI and NDMI values. A time-series comparison and correlation analysis were conducted.

### Preliminary Results

The correlation between mean NDMI and mean NDVI was r = 0.668, with R² = 0.4456. Both indices varied across the observation dates. These results indicate an association between the indices in this dataset, but do not independently confirm crop water stress or determine irrigation requirements.

### Data Source and Limitations

* **Study area:** Buri, Bahrain.
* **Satellite data:** Sentinel-2 Level-2A.
* **Observation period:** 16 August–15 September 2026.
* **Limitation:** The analysis is based on eight observations. Field measurements and additional environmental information are needed to validate possible crop water stress.

**Data distinction:** These findings are derived from Sentinel-2 and are separate from the Planet Tanager demonstration notebooks in this repository.


### Challenges and Limitations

During the initial setup, we encountered difficulties identifying and accurately defining the geographic coordinates of the agricultural study area in Buri, Bahrain. Initial attempts to locate and delineate the target area did not consistently match the intended agricultural plots. We therefore continued developing the proof of concept using Sentinel-2 satellite observations and vegetation and moisture indices (NDVI and NDMI) for the selected study area.

These results provide an initial indication of vegetation conditions and moisture-related patterns. However, satellite-derived indices alone cannot confirm crop water stress or determine irrigation requirements without field observations and additional supporting data.
